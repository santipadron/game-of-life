# Conway's Game of Life 
A terminal version of Conway's Game of Life in Python

Made by Santiago Padron

Inspired by [Robert Heaton's project idea](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/)

## To Run
This project uses the `art` library for ASCII art and the `getkey` library
```
pip install art
pip install getkey
```

To run the game, simply run the `game.py` file
```
python game.py
```


## Implementation

- [x] More testings to confirm that the game functions
- [x] Make the game run forever and update
- [x] Include os module to auto-size to terminal window
- [ ] Make main menu and pause/quit button (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Support to load-from-file
